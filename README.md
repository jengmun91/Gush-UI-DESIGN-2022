As Gush spend approximately 90% of our time indoors. When we leave our homes, we huddle in offices, schools or malls â€“ spaces prone to indoor pollutants.

VOCs, viruses, bacteria, mould, allergens and chemical particles have an effect our physical health, wellbeing and productivity.

At Gush, we create innovative materials for built environments.
Beyond sprucing up homes, our products support general wellbeing while safeguarding our planet.

We believe that everyday choices, however small, can drive purposeful change
